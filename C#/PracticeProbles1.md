### Practice problems to get familier with C#
1. Write a simple 'Hello World' C# program. 
2. Create one project with 2 different classes of different names space and access static and instance methods of one class in to another class.
Note - you cannot access a static method of a class using an object reference in C#. 
3. Write class by defining property and access that in to another class using association. 
4. Make Property for a field with default setter getter methods, and then convert property in to auto property.
5. Make property with conditional getter and setters to understand utilization of field declearation. 
Note - if you define getter definiation of property then also define setter define as well because this time default definitation is not there.
6. Object initilization while creating object without using constructor and override tosting method to print values of object.
