### Practice problems to get familier with C#
1. Write a simple hello C# program. 
2. Create one project with 2 different classes of same names space and access static and instance methods of one class in to another class.
Note - you cannot access a static method of a class using an object reference in C#. 

3. Write class by defining property and access that in to another class. , make conditional getter and setters as well and then convert property in to auto property.
Note - if you define getter definiation of property then also define setter define as well because this time default definitation is not there.

4. Object initilization while creating object without using constructor -  override tosting method to print values of object.
