### C# Key differences with Java
* A solution can have mutiple project inside it.  
*  By default project and solution name is same, while creating project.
*  Default namespace in a project is same name as project name.  
For example, if you create a new console application named "MyConsoleApp," the default namespace for the Program class would be: MyConsoleApp
*  Main method M must be capital.
*  String s is small in main method definition.
* Namespace name,class name,method name ,property name, event names - all must be in pascal case letters.  
*  Field (variables) names, method arguaments are in camel case letters.
