### Practice problems to get familier with WPF
1. Write 'Hello World' label on window form.   
-- Change the label hello world to hi world on loading of form.  
-- show the label in center of the page.  
Note - If you directly drag and drop form component then it will automatically add hardcoded margins to component  definition in xaml file which results not a responsive form.So its recommand to write form by your own.
2. Change the label hello world to hi world on clicking on button.
3. Make a toggel button which change label from running to stop and along with that button label should also change.
4. Create a form with grid of 3x2 where each ractangle filled with different color.
5. Create a form with three rows of different color assuming that 1st row will be header and last row will be footer and then fix the size of first and last row in responsive design.
