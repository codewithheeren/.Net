### Practice problems to get familier with WPF
1. Write 'Hello World' label on window form.   
-- Change the label hello world to hi world on loading of form.  
-- show the label in center of the page.  
Note - If you directly drag and drop form component then it will automatically add hardcoded margins to component  definition in xaml file which results not a responsive form.So its recommand to write form by your own.
2. Change the label hello world to hi world on clicking on button.
3. Make a toggel button which change label from running to stop and along with that button label should also change.
